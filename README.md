# death-in-NY-R-project
In this project, I used R to find out if certain causes of death are experienced disproportionately by different demographics in New York City. I then created visualizations to make disparities more visible and intuitive.\n
My goal with this project was to explore if there were disparities between how certain causes of death affect people of different demographics in New York City. I examined data between boroughs, races, and genders. I then made visualizations with ggplot2 to display the disparities that I found.\n

The data used in this project came from Kaggle:\n
